# Stopwatch
This is a simple Stopwatch web app project made using plain javascript. 

- I have used **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** to make this small project, it is a Stopwatch application having the functionality to **Start**, **Stop** and **Reset** the timer in it, also have styled it with a little bit of CSS.
